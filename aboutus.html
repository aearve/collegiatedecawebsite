Additionally, we organize workshops on resume building, interview preparation, and public speaking, while also hosting guest speakers from the business community to share valuable insights. Our chapter offers numerous networking opportunities, connecting members with industry professionals, alumni, and peers. We are also committed to community involvement, participating in service projects, fundraising events for local charities, and volunteering in community outreach programs.
